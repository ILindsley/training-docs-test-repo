However, at times, ideas will be written out to help facilitators think through the purpose of activities and visuals. Feel free to use those ideas in your training, or feel free to craft your own materials for your context.</p><p id="18f72d5a-f2de-80a9-ae6c-d2737e4a64bf" class=""><strong>Focus of Session</strong>: Translators will learn the variety of translation choices they will need to make in order to create a translation brief as they prepare to translate. </p><p id="18f72d5a-f2de-80fd-a96a-f08b7a926944" class=""><strong>Why this is important to translators:</strong> Translation is, in many respects, an art and translations will differ based on the person drafting the translation. Translators need to recognize the qualities that distinguish a good translation and incorporate them into the work that they do. Understanding these qualities and being able to identify them will prepare them to draft a translation brief. </p><p id="18f72d5a-f2de-807f-b6f1-cb5513a24f3d" class=""><strong>Prior knowledge:</strong> Since this is a problem-based training method, translators do not have to have prior knowledge on the qualities of good translation. However, it is wise that they be familiar with the Bible through commitment to studying it. IDEALLY ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE BIBLE WELL DOWNLOADED ON THEIR DEVICES PRIOR TO THIS SESSION.</p><figure class="block-color-gray_background callout" style="white-space:pre-wrap;display:flex" id="19972d5a-f2de-80be-9edc-ee2c8c510c0c"><div style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="icon">üí°</span></div><div style="width:100%"><p id="19972d5a-f2de-80fd-b6f4-efcf3accf743" class="">IDEALLY ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE BIBLE WELL DOWNLOADED ON THEIR DEVICES PRIOR TO THIS SESSION.</p></div></figure><p id="18f72d5a-f2de-80ab-be33-f397ba0f2c60" class=""><strong>Method</strong>: This training uses a modified form of Problem-Based Learning to train translators in processes that foster both the skills and principles of Bible translation. Instead of starting with high-level concepts and ideas, this approach fosters a hands-on approach to training. Learners are introduced to translation principles at the same time they are learning-by-doing the practices of good translation.</p><p id="18f72d5a-f2de-8025-a4f1-c22fb31b9e59" class=""><strong>Session Objectives:</strong> Participants will draft a set of translations and evaluate them to identify the qualities of a good translation that they want to include in their translation brief. </p><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.5em;line-height:1.3;margin:0">Introduction to Drafting - See üëÄ</summary><div class="indented"><p id="19972d5a-f2de-809a-bf6c-cf1a820e31aa" class=""><em>Facilitator note: </em>Beginning with translating Scripture is very challenging. If you have the time and the trust of those you are training, we would recommend doing these two introductory activities first. However, we realize the reality is often you have only a few days to train and those you are training may only want to do Scripture. They may not trust you enough to lead them down a path of self-discovery.
